The Solarpunk Knowledge Repository is a Digital Garden, a growing network of knowledge and ideas that will be useful in building a more hopeful, ecological and just society, starting today.

You can start exploring the site using the [[Atlas]] or the [[Visual Sitemap]] (though there is no content yet).

Contributions to the repository are very welcome. The source code, including all of the content, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/qv1et/solarpunk-knowledge-repository).
