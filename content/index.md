The Solarpunk Knowledge Repository is a Digital Garden, a growing network of knowledge and ideas that will be useful in building a more hopeful, ecological and just society, starting today.

If you are new to Solarpunk, you could start [[z_solarpunk|here]]. To learn more about the goal of this site, check out [[p_solarpunk-knowledge-repository|this page]]. You can also explore the site from a bird's eye view using the [[m_atlas|Atlas]] or the [[m_visual-sitemap|Visual Sitemap]] (though there is no content yet).

Contributions to the repository are very welcome. The source code, including all of the content, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/qv1et/solarpunk-knowledge-repository).
