The Solarpunk Knowledge Repository is a Digital Garden, a growing network of knowledge and ideas that will be useful in building a more hopeful, ecological and just society, starting today.

Here are some pointers to help you, find your way around the site:
- If you are new to Solarpunk, you can start [[z_solarpunk|here]].
- If you want to connect to other Solarpunks, either online or in real-life, take a look at the [[m_solarpunk-communities|Solarpunk Communities]] page.
- To learn more about the goal of this site, check out [[p_solarpunk-knowledge-repository|this page]].
- In the future you will be able to explore the site from a bird's eye view using the [[m_atlas|Atlas]] or the [[m_visual-sitemap|Visual Sitemap]] (there is no content yet).
