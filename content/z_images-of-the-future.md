title: ðŸŒ² Images of the Future

The dutch sociologist Fred Polak coined the term "Image of the Future". He argued that the images of the future that we hold are actively driving us towards a certain future.

> When the dominant images of a culture are anticipatory, they "lead" social development and provide direction for social change.

In the post-modern era there has been a decline in utopian images of the future. The result is a society in decline.

> In Polak's reading of history, optimism about reality combined with a utopian sense of human empowerment set in motion a powerful dynamic. Utopian optimism has
> characterized the Western worldview of recent centuries - but not of the last few decades.
> 
> In eras when pessimism combines with a sense of cosmic helplessness, the quality of human intentionality declines and, with it, the quality of imagery of the not-yet. Societies in that condition live bounded by the present, with no social dynamic for change available to them.
