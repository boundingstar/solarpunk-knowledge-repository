  - Solarpunk Knowledge Repository
title: 🛠️ Solarpunk Knowledge Repository
---
The goal of this site is to gather and synthesize the information we need to put Solarpunk into practice. There are already many great resources out there and the idea is not to recreate them, but to serve as a meta resource. The idea is to grow a densely interconnected network of pages that help others discover and make sense of the information they need to start taking action, for example to
1) [[m_educate-and-inspire|Educate & Inspire]]
2) [[m_build-and-plant|Build & Plant]] 
3) [[m_organize-and-resist|Organize & Resist]]

We may need to start small but

> Small is good, small is all.\

Starting small also does not mean that we are starting from zero. There are many people, communities and whole movements that have been working for decades on ecological living, appropriate technology, permaculture, social and climate justice, decolonization and other areas that are related to Solarpunk.
